Viewer for Luna, an FXHash project by Geoff Stearns.

There are two ways to use the viewer:
1. Look up a token id either via your wallet or on the fxhash website and set it as a 'tokenid' url parameter, like so: https://geoffstearns.com/luna-viewer/index.html?tokenid=176504
1. Use the tx hash from your token and set it as the 'fxhash' url parameter, like so: https://geoffstearns.com/luna-viewer/index.html?fxhash=oog1gEhnpnNrjCQpBmNcERpdyzqtsgetzHCqFJ3nHZE8dTFm97w

Your Token ID can be found on the token page and is usually a 6 digit number following some text like "GENTK#123456" above the token name.

The transaction hash is listed in the token information section of each token's page following the text "Transaction hash:".
